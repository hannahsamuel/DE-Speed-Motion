# DE End of Course Project: Speed Calculator
#### By: Hannah Samuel
## Introduction
### For my final project in Digital Electronics, I wanted to use my arduino skills to calculate speed of an object moving on a straight path from an inital destination to a final destination. I chose these project because it is very applicable to the movemnt of vechicles on the road today and provides good insight on how to implement more safer guidlines. So this inspired me to create a minituare model of how the the speed of moving object would be calculated. In addition to calculated, I wanted the user to see this information visibly on a platform such as the speed limit signs that convey the speed of a incoming driver.
